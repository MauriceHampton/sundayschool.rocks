  - you can add functions to all strings by setting them on String.prototype
  - arrays too, same way
  - you can make your own cool types (CoolArray) kinda like this:

\`\`\`javascript
function CoolArray () {}
CoolArray.prototype = Array
CoolArray.addAnAlp = function () { this.push('alp') }
\`\`\`

- talk about libraries [see this codepen](http://codepen.io/amonks/pen/VmYQNV?editors=0010)

We had a pretty good session last week. We talked for a while about how
best to publicize your work on the internet (social media!) and then we
brainstormed about algorithms for identifying heart-shaped things.

Good times!

We didn't keep any notes :/
